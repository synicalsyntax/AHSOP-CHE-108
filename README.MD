# AHSOP CHE 108

[AHSOP CHE 108](http://clin-dump.co.nf/ahsop-che108/) is a collective database of files related to the CHE 108 Introduction to Chemistry course at [California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH)](http://www4.csudh.edu).

The website was developed to aid students from the [California Academy of Math and Science (CAMS)](http://lbcams.schoolloop.com) taking the course as a participant in the [American Honda Science Opportunity Program (AHSOP)](http://www.csudhnews.com/2016/06/honda-science-opportunity/).

The database features a variety of resources, including syllabuses, lecture presentations, practice exams, and an online textbook, to help prepare students for exams.

Multiple students acknowledged that AHSOP CHE 108 was a valuable resource and they would not have passed the course without using AHSOP CHE 108.
